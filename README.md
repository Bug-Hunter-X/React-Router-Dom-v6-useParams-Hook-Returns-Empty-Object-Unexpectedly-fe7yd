This repository demonstrates a common issue with React Router v6's useParams hook: returning an empty object when used outside a directly matched route.  The `useParamsBug.js` file shows the problem, where the `UserProfile` component receives an empty object from `useParams` even though it's intended to display user data based on the route parameter. The `useParamsSolution.js` provides a solution using `useLocation` and manually extracting the parameters from the pathname. The solution showcases the importance of understanding route nesting and how `useParams` relies on its context.
