In React Router Dom v6, using the `useParams` hook inside a component that's not directly nested within a route that matches the params will result in an empty object. This can happen when your component is deeply nested or conditionally rendered, leading to unexpected behavior.  For example, if you are trying to access the parameter 'id' from a route such as '/users/:id', in a component that's several levels deep and not directly under the '/users/:id' route, useParams will return an empty object.
